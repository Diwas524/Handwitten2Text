Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It can also be defined as the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit human intervention, relying on patterns and inference instead. Similarly, a mathematical equation is a statement that defines the equality of two expression which can be used to define almost all the remaining mathematical theorems and science theories.
